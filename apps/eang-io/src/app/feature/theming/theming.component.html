    <p>Unlike other component frameworks, eang does not abstract or encapsulates away the power of CSS. Instead it embraces
      the new capabilities of CSS and puts design back into the hand of the designer. Components and designs are continously
      evolving. eang's philosophy is to allow developers and designers to work idependently from eachother as much as possible
      by providing a sematic contract. This allows design changes and features to be deployed on a different cadence. It
      is not necessary to redeploy the whole application just because colors changed.
    </p>
    <p>To enable and designs to evolve at a different speed, it is often a common practice to create a design prototype as a
      seperate application. As much as this provides the necessary flexibility for product development, it is costly and
      limited. The protype often does not have the same data or functionality as the real application. With eang and it's
      seperation of concerns between design and functionailty, new designs can be safely tested on a production application
      and it enables you to avoid the costs of a prototype.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      If that is not enough, eang allows you to define the CSS of each component individually additional themes can be be added.
      This allows users of eang to fully customize the the look and feel of each component and makes it easy to comply with
      Coporate Design guidelines. eang embraces CSS and takes advatage of upcoming CSS features. PostCSS is used to support
      all older browsers.</p>
