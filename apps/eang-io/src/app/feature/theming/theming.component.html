  <h2>Themeing</h2>
  <p>Styling and theming in eang is fully customizable and can be easily changed.</p>
  <p>Unlike other component frameworks, the style is not set in stone and does not abstract or encapsulates away the power of
    CSS. Instead it embraces the new capabilities of CSS and puts design back into the hand of the designer.

    Properties and nesting and uses a PostCSS pipeline to support older browsers.</p>
